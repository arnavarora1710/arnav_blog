# Why Number Theory?

So, this semester, I&rsquo;m enrolled in [a course on Number Theory](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~twooley/2025nt/2025nt.html) with the amazing [Prof. Wooley](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~twooley/). I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the subject, but never really had the chance to study it in depth. I&rsquo;m really excited to learn more about it, and I thought it would be a good idea to document my journey through the course.


## What will I include here?

I will be taking notes in class (in org-mode): so I thought it would be a good idea to publish them. I will also be solving problems from the textbook, and I will include my solutions here. I will also include any interesting facts or theorems that I come across.


## Why am I doing this?

I think that writing about what I learn will help me understand the material better. I also think that it will be a good way to keep myself accountable in taking notes. I&rsquo;m sure that proofreading my notes will also help me catch any mistakes that I make.


# What Now?

But yeah, that&rsquo;s about it. I&rsquo;m really excited to get started with this course, and I hope that you enjoy reading my notes!
