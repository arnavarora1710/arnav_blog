Welcome to my blog! I'm Arnav Arora, a junior at Purdue double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. Here, I'll talk about all the things that fascinate me focussing on:

1. **[Interesting CS/Math Problems](./Interesting%20Stuff%20IDK/What's%20Here?%20-%20Miscellaneous.md)**: Exploring challenging problems with solutions

2. **[Books I Read](What's%20Here?%20-%20Books.md)**: Highlights from impactful math books, with the occasional CS read.

3. **[Competitive Programming](What's%20Here?%20-%20CP.md)**: Data structures/algorithms knowledge I pick up from competitive programming

4. **[Machine Learning](What's%20Here?%20-%20ML.md)**: notes/insights/techniques from my personal/university projects
